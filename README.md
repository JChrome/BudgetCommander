# BudgetCommander

BudgetCommander is a simple, lightweight application that manages your budget. By scraping your banks transactions when you view the transactions page, the application will be a locally hosted version of your transactions in perpetuity (most credit card vendors won't give you activity prior to 3 months). The transactions are stored in a SQLite DB and can be accessed either through the terminal or through the web portal.

BudgetCommander offers complete control over the number of categories, subCategories, and methods of analysis for one's budget.

Current banks supported:

1) Chase (Old static HTML platform for Credit Cards and Debit)
2) Chase (New single page application platform)
3) (Please add your own :-))
